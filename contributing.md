- Put content so that even people starting from the square one can get started. Only put content that is acceptable and is within the bounds of Minecraft Speedrunning Rules.
- No unnecessary clogging or text bricks. Seperate large blocks using  `---` dividers.
- Keep everything modular : Use `#`* n where n is nesting count to create blocks .
- If adding info on `Versions` , add all the possible pros and cons and other issues (if applicable)
- Images/Gifs should be referenced from `#src-img` directory.
- Do NOT spam emojiis . Use `:grey-exclamation` for `NOTES` and `:exclamation:` for Warning. `:snowflake:` can be used to refer to block headers.
